Ergopose is an intelligent posture analysis system tailored for industrial ergonomics. It leverages Ultralytics YOLOv8 Pose for real-time human pose estimation, enabling accurate detection of key joint positions. Using vector-based calculations, Ergopose computes joint angles and evaluates ergonomic risks based on three widely accepted methodologies: REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment), RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment), and the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation.
Designed for seamless integration with camera systems and industrial monitoring setups, Ergopose supports continuous posture tracking and automated risk scoring. This helps organizations proactively identify high-risk postures, reduce workplace injuries, and enhance safety compliance.
